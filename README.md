## EDUCATION

Top universities are incorporating SIMBA Chain’s education tools into their blockchain curriculum. SIMBA’s easy-to-use platform offers students hands-on experience in developing smart contracts, API’s and decentralized applications (dapps) that deploy on multiple blockchains.
It’s imperative that future generations have a proper understanding of blockchain, what it has to offer, and how to build on it efficiently. SIMBA’s Education tools can supplement existing curriculum and offer a wide range of support for professors and students alike. SIMBA Chain brings blockchain verification and immutability to certifications, training, and other professional credentials with an easy-to-use application



## NFT MARKETPLACES

There may be other places to mint and sell NFTs but the user experience often falls short. Your fans and brand deserve better.
SIMBA offers a white-label NFT Marketplace that is intuitive and simple for the users and gives the brand complete control. These marketplaces are manage through an easy-to-use admin panel that requires no coding or blockchain knowledge.

## SIMBA also offers a QUICKSTART 

SIMBA QuickStart provides a generic API to multiple blockchains so the system does not have a dependency on a single blockchain or distributed ledger technology. 
Smart contracts are generated through a simple interface named the Smart Contract Designer (SCD). Users add assets or transactions along with their methods and parameters, and QuickStart automatically generates Solidity code for the smart contract.

# Supported BLOCKCHAINS include:
SIMBA'S API lets you pick from any of our supported blockchains, and gives you the freedom to transition in the future. Does not have a dependency on a single blockchain or distributed ledger technology.

>SIMBA Chain and the University of Notre Dame have partnered with TOKS Restaurants to track their coffee bean supply chain. TOKS operates 208 locations across Mexico and wanted greater visibility and traceability in its supply chain.
>Not only will it provide transparency and ensure quality, but consumers will be able to see where their coffee came from and who grew it

>Joel Neidig, CEO and Co-founder of SIMBA Chain, says his company’s blockchain platform is a great solution for food and beverage companies facing regulatory and consumer demand for provenance information on consumable products. “Smart contracts are a powerful tool for food producers and restaurant companies that want to bring enhanced security and traceability to their supply chain. I commend Toks for taking a leadership role in developing a blockchain-enabled supply chain prototype that adds value for coffee farmers, restaurants, customers, and to the food and restaurant industries at large.”

>Toks is leader in sustainability practices. The company works directly with cooperatives of small farmers, whose coffee beans go into every cup of coffee served. The supply chain is complex; the coffee beans are grown, harvested, graded, deshelled, roasted, and shipped to each restaurant. Toks turned to SIMBA Chain and the University of Notre Dame to gain greater visibility and traceability in its supply chain. SIMBA Chain worked with Notre Dame to define the pilot during a visit to Toks and the farming communities in late 2019. Among the goals is to validate and ensure quality along each supply chain step and help broaden coffee product lines to enable new, innovative business models for more ethical and sustainable production for the farming communities.
This project began in May 2020
